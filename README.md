Advantages of this project:
- Nextjs for auto splitting pages on chunks and other features
- Separate layouts for landing page and app
- Modern redux toolkit with RTK query
- i18n implementation with redux only without deps
- Swap page translated on russian language
- Snackbar on redux only without deps, example notifications when connec/disconnect
- Light and dark theme
- Landing page

Planned but didn't have time to implement:
- add liquidity page
- charts
- animations
- full typesctipt typing
- about and faq pages
- some refactoring

I only found out about the contest a week ago, so did not have time to implement a lot of things.
if you like my prototype I can continue.
